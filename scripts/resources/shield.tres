description = "A disc of wood, hefty, with leather forearm straps and a handle on the concave side. The front is covered with a sheet of bronze, the surface polished to a mirror-like finish. The fastenings feel comfortable on your arm, as does the weight in your hand. Yet… as you stare at the image reflected in the shield, a striking absence tempers your expectations."
