maiden_euryale: You hold the same weakness as our sister, you reek of it.
maiden_euryale: Your finality breeds urgency, a need for change in the short time available.
maiden_euryale: We have no such perturbations.
maiden_stheno: [signal=stheno_talk]Here… forever…
maiden_stheno: You die... before... we leave...
maiden_euryale: [signal=euryale_talk]We can wait, and we will, as long as need be...
maiden_euryale: …and when you return, here we will be still.
